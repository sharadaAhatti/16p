                <b>WELCOME TO Version 9.0 of Introduction to Programming Using Java,</b> a free, on-line textbook for 
                introductory programming that uses <i>Java</i> as the language of instruction. This book is directed 
                mainly towards beginning programmers, although it might also be useful for experienced programmers
                who want to learn something about <i>Java</i>.

              <u> Version 9 covers Java 17.</u> It updates the previous version mostly by moving definitively to <i>Java</i> 17 
               and by adding a new Swing edition. This edition of Version 9 uses <i>Java</i>FX for GUI programming; an 
               alternative edition that uses Swing instead of JavaFX is also available. Earlier versions of the
            book are also available; see the preface for links to older versions.

              You can the download this web site for use on your own computer. <u>PDF, e-book, and print versions</u> of 
              the textbook are also available. Links can be found at the bottom of this page.
